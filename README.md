# Voltage level translator card for RC2014
This is a design for an add-on card for the [RC2014 Z80 Retro computer kit](https://rc2014.co.uk/) which provides a bidirectional, voltage level translated bus interface.  The pinout of the IDC connector is designed for direct connection to a Terasic DE0 Nano FPGA development board, which features an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA.  A separate 0.1" pin header row is included in the design for use with other peripherals.

This design is for the original RC2014 backplane, not the Backplane Pro.
